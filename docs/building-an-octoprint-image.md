# Building your own octoprint image

In some circumstances, the best approach will be to build off of the base
`octoprint/octoprint` image and add your own customizations and reproducible
builds. Here are a few common scenarios you might find yourself wanting to do this:

- you require additional OS packages for plugins
- you want to distribute your own special version of OctoPrint 
- you want a common set of plugins installed for a distributable image

Docs coming soon, but this will follow common Docker usage, and here are a few good
resources:
